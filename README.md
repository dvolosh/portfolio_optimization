### Overview 

## Efficient Frontier with custom sector and locational constraint
- Mean-Variance Optimization of a portfolio contingent on sector, asset type and location using Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage
- The goal is to have a diversified portfolio with low covariance between assets and maximise the Sharpe ratio subject to aggregate constraints


## Monte Carlo Simulation focused on maximizing sharpe and minimizing market exposure 
- The goal of this analysis was to optimize a portfolio's performance using a combination of quantitative strategies, specifically focusing on achieving a high Sharpe ratio, while maintaining a low beta relative to the market. 
- Employed Monte Carolo Simulation to generate a wide range of possible portfolio outcomes based on random sampling, which helps in maximizing the Sharpe ratio and minimizing the portfolio beta.
- The portfolio adheres to a standard 120-20 investment strategy, allowing for a 120% long position and a 20% short position. Additionally, applied a trailing stop loss to reduce the portfolioâ€™s exposure to sudden market downturns, ensuring that losses are capped at a predefined threshold.
- Key metrics such as Sharpe ratio, beta, and maximum drawdown were calculated to evaluate the performance and risk profile of the optimized portfolio.
